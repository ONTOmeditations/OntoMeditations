OntoMeditations is a Knowledge Representation and Knowledge Extraction (KRKE) course project, made as part of the Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge (DHDK) program of the Università di Bologna.

Engaged with Marcus Aurelius’ Meditations, a major work of Stoic philosophy, our project uses linguistic and sentiment analysis digital techniques applied to a dedicated ontology. The aim is to read and understand this rich philosophical work, as well as its iconic author-emperor-thinker-feeler, in novel ways, through digital lights.
