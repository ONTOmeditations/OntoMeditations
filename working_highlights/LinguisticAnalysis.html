          <div id="content1">
      <p><br>1. From my grandfather Verus:
the lessons of noble character and even
temper.
<br>2. From my father’s reputation and my memory of him: modesty and
manliness.
<br>3. From my mother: piety and bountifulness, to keep myself not only from
doing evil but even from dwelling on evil thoughts, simplicity too in diet
and to be far removed from the ways of the rich.
<br>4. From my mother’s grandfather: not to have attended public schools but
enjoyed good teachers at home, and to have learned the lesson that on
things like these it is a duty to spend liberally.
<br>5. From my tutor: not to become a partisan of the Green jacket or the Blue
in the races, nor of Thracian or Samnite gladiators;
to bear pain and be
content with little; to work with my own hands, to <span property="reason">mind</span> my own business,
and to be slow to listen to slander.
<br>6. From Diognetus: to avoid idle enthusiasms; to disbelieve the professions
of sorcerers and impostors about incantations and exorcism of spirits and
the like; not to cock-fight or to be excited about such sports; to put up
with plain-speaking and to become familiar with philosophy; to hear the
lectures first of Baccheius
, then of Tandasis and Marcian, in boyhood to
write essays and to aspire to the camp-bed and skin coverlet and the other
things which are part of the Greek training.
<br>7. From Rusticus: to get an impression of need for reform and treatment
of character; not to run off into zeal for rhetoric, writing on speculative
themes, discoursing on edifying texts, exhibiting in fanciful colours the
ascetic or the philanthropist. To avoid oratory, poetry, and preciosity; not to
parade at home in ceremonial costume or to do things of that kind; to write
letters in the simple style, like his own from Sinuessa to my mother. To be
easily recalled to myself and easily reconciled with those who provoke
and offend, as soon as they are willing to meet me. To read books
accurately and not be satisfied with superficial thinking about things or
agree hurriedly with those who talk round a subject. To have made the
acquaintance of the Discourses of Epictetus, of which he allowed me to
share a copy of his own.
<br>8. From Apollonius: moral freedom, not to expose oneself to the
insecurity of <span property="providence">fortune</span>; to look to nothing else, even for a little while, except
to <span property="reason">reason</span>. To be always the same, in sharp attacks of pain, in the loss of a
child, in long illnesses. To see clearly in a living example that a man can be
at once very much in earnest and yet able to relax.
Not to be censorious in exposition; and to see a man who plainly considered
technical knowledge and ease in communicating general truths as the least
of his good gifts. The lesson how one ought to receive from friends what
are esteemed favours, neither lowering oneself on their account, nor
returning them tactlessly.
<br>9. From Sextus: graciousness, and the pattern of a household governed by
its head, and the notion of life according to <span property="nature">Nature</span>. Dignity without
pretence, solicitous consideration for friends, tolerance of amateurs and of
those whose opinions have no ground in science.
A happy accommodation to every man, so that not only was his
conversation more agreeable than any flattery, but he excited the greatest
reverence at that very time in the very persons about him. Certainty of
grasp, and method in the discovery and arrangement of the principles
necessary to human life.
Never to give the impression of anger or of any other passion, but to be at
once entirely passionless and yet full of natural affection. To praise without
noise, to be widely learned without display.
<br>10. From Alexander the grammarian: to avoid <span property="justice">fault</span>-finding and not to
censure in a carping spirit any who employ an exotic phrase, a solecism, or
harsh expression, but oneself to use, neatly and precisely, the correct phrase,
by way of answer or confirmation or handling of the actual question—the
thing, not its verbal expression—or by some other equally happy reminder.
<br>11. From Fronto: to observe how vile a thing is the malice and caprice
and hypocrisy of absolutism; and generally speaking that those whom we
entitle ‘Patricians’ are somehow rather wanting in the natural affections.
<br>12. From Alexander the Platonist: seldom and only when absolutely
necessary to say to anyone or write in a letter: ‘I am too busy’; nor by such
a turn of phrase to evade continually the duties incident to our relations to
those who live with us, on the plea of ‘present circumstances’.
<br>13. From Catulus: not to neglect a friend’s remonstrance, even if he may
be unreasonable in his remonstrance, but to endeavour to restore him to his
usual temper. Hearty praise, too, of teachers, like what is recorded of
Athenodotus and Domitius, and genuine love towards children.
<br>14. From Severus: love of family, love of <span property="reason">truth</span>, and love of <span property="justice">justice</span>. To
have got by his help to understand Thrasea, Helvidius, Cato, Dio, Brutus,
and to conceive the idea of a commonwealth based on equity and freedom
of speech, and of a monarchy cherishing above all the liberty of the
subject. From him, too, consistency and uniformity in regard for
philosophy; to do good, to communicate liberally, to be hopeful; to believe
in the affection of friends and to use no concealment towards those who
incurred his censure, and that his friends had no <span property="nature">necessity</span> to conjecture his
wishes or the reverse, but he was open with them.
<br>15. From Maximus: mastery of self and vacillation in nothing;
cheerfulness in all circumstances and especially in illness. A happy blend of
character, mildness with dignity, readiness to do without complaining what
is given to be done. To see how in his case everyone believed ‘he really
thinks what he says, and what he does, he does without evil intent’; not to
be surprised or alarmed; nowhere to be in a hurry or to procrastinate, not to
lack resource or to be depressed or cringing or on the other hand angered or
suspicious. To be generous, forgiving, void of deceit. To give the
impression of inflexible rectitude rather than of one who is corrected. The
fact, too, that no one would ever have dreamt that he was looked down on
by him or would have endured to conceive himself to be his superior. To be
agreeable also (in social life).
<br>16. From my father (by adoption): gentleness and unshaken resolution in
judgements taken after full examination; no vainglory about external
honours; love of work and perseverance; readiness to hear those who had
anything to contribute to the public advantage; the desire to award to every
man according to desert without partiality; the experience that knew where
to tighten the rein, where to relax. Prohibition of unnatural practices,
social tact and permission to his suite not invariably to be present at his
banquets nor to attend his progress from Rome, as a <span property="nature">matter</span> of obligation,
and always to be found the same by those who had failed to attend him
through engagements. Exact scrutiny in council and patience; not that he
was avoiding investigation, satisfied with first impressions. An inclination
to keep his friends, and nowhere fastidious or the victim of manias but his
own master in everything, and his outward mien cheerful. His long
foresight and ordering of the merest trifle without making scenes. The
check in his reign put upon organized applause and every form of lipservice; his unceasing watch over the needs of the empire and his
stewardship of its resources; his patience under criticism by individuals of
such conduct. No superstitious fear of divine powers or with man any
courting of the public or obsequiousness or cultivation of popular favour,
but <span property="justice">temperance</span> in all things and firmness; nowhere want of taste or search
for novelty.
In the things which contribute to life’s comfort, where <span property="providence">fortune</span> was lavish to
him, use without display and at the same time without apology, so as to take
them when they were there quite simply and not to require them when they
were absent. The fact that no one would have said that he was a sophist, an
impostor, or a pedant, but a ripe man, an entire man, above flattery, able to
preside over his own and his subjects’ business.
Besides all this the inclination to respect genuine followers of philosophy,
but towards the other sort no tendency to reproach nor on the other hand to
be hoodwinked by them; affability, too, and humour, but not to excess. Care
of his health in moderation, not as one in love with living nor with an eye to
personal appearance nor on the other hand neglecting it, but so far as by
attention to self to need doctoring or medicine and external applications for
very few ailments.
A very strong point, to give way without jealousy to those who had some
particular gift like literary expression or knowledge of the Civil <span property="nature">Law</span> or
customs or other matters, even sharing their enthusiasm that each might get
the reputation due to his individual excellence. Acting always according to
the tradition of our forefathers, yet not endeavouring that this regard for
tradition should be noticed. No tendency, moreover, to chop and change, but
a settled course in the same places and the same practices. After acute
attacks of headache, fresh and vigorous at once for his accustomed duties;
and not to have many secrets, only very few and by way of exception, and
those solely because of matters of State. Discretion and moderation alike in
the provision of shows, in carrying out public works, in donations to the
populace, and so on; the behaviour in fact of one who has an eye precisely
to what it is his duty to do, not to the reputation which attends the doing.
He was not one who bathed at odd hours, not fond of building, no
connoisseur of the table, of the stuff and colour of his dress, of the beauty of
his slaves. His costume was brought to Rome from his country house at
Lorium; his manner of life at Lanuvium; the way he treated the taxcollector who apologized at Tusculum, and all his behaviour of that sort.
Nowhere harsh, merciless, or blustering, nor so that you might ever say ‘to
fever heat’, but everything nicely calculated and divided into its times, as
by a leisured man; no bustle, complete order, strength, consistency. What is
recorded of Socrates would exactly fit him: he could equally be abstinent
from or enjoy what many are too weak to abstain from and too selfindulgent in enjoying. To be strong, to endure, and in either case to be sober
belong to the man of perfect and invincible spirit, like the spirit of Maximus
in his illness.
<br>17. From the <span property="providence">gods</span>: to have had good grandparents, good parents, a good
sister, good masters, good intimates, kinsfolk, friends, almost everything;
and that in regard to not one of them did I stumble into offence, although I
had the kind of disposition which might in some circumstances have led me
to behave thus; but it was the goodness of the <span property="providence">gods</span> that no conjunction of
events came about which was likely to expose my weakness. That I was not
brought up longer than I was with my grandfather’s second wife, that I
preserved the flower of my youth and did not play the man before my time,
but even delayed a little longer. That my station in life was under a
governor and a father who was to strip off all my pride and to lead me to
see that it is possible to live in a palace and yet not to need a bodyguard or
embroidered uniforms or candelabra and statues bearing lamps and the like
accompaniments of pomp, but that one is able to contract very nearly to a
private station and not on that account to lose dignity or to be more remiss
in the duties that a prince must perform on behalf of the public. That I met
with so good a brother,
able by his character not only to rouse me to care
of myself but at the same time to hearten me by respect and natural
affection; that my children were not deficient in <span property="reason">mind</span> nor deformed in
<span property="psy-body">body</span>; that I made no further progress in eloquence and poetry and those
other pursuits wherein, had I seen myself progressing along an easy road, I
should perhaps have become absorbed. That I made haste to advance my
masters to the honours which they appeared to covet and did not put them
off with hopes that, as they were still young, I should do it later on. To have
got to know Apollonius, Rusticus, Maximus. To have pictured to myself
clearly and repeatedly what life in obedience to <span property="nature">Nature</span> really is, so that,
so far as concerns the <span property="providence">gods</span> and communications from the other world, and
aids and inspirations, nothing hinders my living at once in obedience to
<span property="nature">Nature</span>, though I still come somewhat short of this by my own <span property="justice">fault</span> and by
not observing the reminders and almost the instructions of the <span property="providence">gods</span>. That
my <span property="psy-body">body</span> has held out so well in a life like mine; that I did not touch
Benedicta or Theodotus,but that even in later years when I experienced
the passion of love I was cured; that though I was often angry with Rusticus
I never went to extremes for which I should have been sorry; that though
my mother was <span property="providence">fate</span>d to die young, she still spent her last years with me.
That whenever I wanted to help anyone in poverty or some other <span property="nature">necessity</span> I
was never told that I could not afford it, and that I did not myself fall into
the same <span property="nature">necessity</span> so as to take help from another; that my wife is what
she is, so obedient, so affectionate, and so simple; that I was well provided
with suitable tutors for my children. That I was granted assistance in
dreams, especially how to avoid spitting blood and fits of giddiness, and
the answer of the oracle at Caieta: ‘Even as thou shalt employ thyself; and
that, although in love with philosophy, I did not meet with any sophist or
retire to disentangle literary works or syllogisms or busy myself with
problems ‘in the clouds’.For all these things require ‘the <span property="providence">gods</span> to help and
<span property="providence">Fortune</span>’s hand’.
      </p>
      </div>

          <div id="content2">
<br><p>1. Say to yourself in the early morning:
I shall meet today inquisitive,
ungrateful, violent, treacherous, envious, uncharitable men. All these things
have come upon them through <span property="reason">ignorance</span> of real good and ill. But I,
because I have seen that the <span property="nature">nature</span> of good is the right, and of ill the wrong,
and that the <span property="nature">nature</span> of the man himself who does wrong is akin to my own
(not of the same blood and seed, but partaking with me in <span property="reason">mind</span>, that is in a
portion of <span property="providence">divinity</span>),
I can neither be harmed by any of them, for no man
will involve me in wrong, nor can I be angry with my kinsman or hate him;
for we have come into the world to work together, like feet, like hands, like
eyelids, like the rows of upper and lower teeth. To work against one another
therefore is to oppose <span property="nature">Nature</span>, and to be vexed with another or to turn away
from him is to tend to antagonism.
<br>2. This whatever it is that I am, is <span property="psy-body">flesh</span> and <span property="psy-body">vital spirit</span> and the governing
self. Disdain the <span property="psy-body">flesh</span>: blood and bones and network, a twisted skein of
nerves, veins, arteries. Consider also what the <span property="psy-body">vital spirit</span> is: a current of air,
not even continuously the same, but every hour being expelled and sucked
in again. There is then a third part, the <span property="power">governing self</span>. Put away your books,
be distracted no longer, they are not your portion. Rather, as if on the point
of <span property="death">death</span>, reflect like this: ‘you are an old man, suffer this governing part of
you no longer to be in bondage, no longer to be a puppet pulled by selfish
<span property="psy-body">impulse</span>, no longer to be indignant with what is allotted in the present or to
suspect what is allotted in the future.’
<br>3. The work of the <span property="providence">gods</span> is full of <span property="providence">Providence</span>: the work of <span property="providence">fortune</span> is not
divorced from <span property="nature">Nature</span> or the spinning and winding of the threads ordained
by <span property="providence">Providence</span>. All flows from that other world; and there is, besides,
<span property="nature">necessity</span> and the well-being of the whole <span property="nature">universe</span>, whereof you are a part.
Now to every part of <span property="nature">Nature</span> that is good which the <span property="nature">nature</span> of the <span property="nature">Whole</span>
brings, and which preserves that <span property="nature">nature</span>; and the whole world is preserved as
much by the changes of the compound bodies as by the changes of the
elements which compose those bodies. Let this be sufficient for you, these
be continually your doctrines. But put away your thirst for books,
that so
you may not die murmuring, but truly reconciled and grateful from your
heart to the <span property="providence">gods</span>.
<br>4. Remember how long you have been putting off these things, and how
many times the <span property="providence">gods</span> have given you days of grace, and yet you do not use
them. Now is it high time to perceive the kind of <span property="nature">Universe</span> whereof you are
a part and the <span property="nature">nature</span> of the governor of the <span property="nature">Universe</span> from whom you
subsist as an effluence, and that the term of your time is circumscribed, and
that unless you use it to attain calm of <span property="reason">mind</span>, time will be gone and you will
be gone and the opportunity to use it will not be yours again.
<br>5. Each hour be minded, valiantly as becomes a Roman and a man, to do
what is to your hand, with precise . . . and unaffected dignity, natural love,
freedom and <span property="justice">justice</span>; and to give yourself repose from every other
imagination. And so you will, if only you do each act as though it were your
last, freed from every random aim, from wilful turning away from the
directing <span property="reason">Reason</span>, from pretence, self-love and displeasure with what is
allotted to you. You see how few things a man need master in order to live a
smooth and <span property="providence">god</span>-fearing life; for the <span property="providence">gods</span> themselves will require nothing
more of him who keeps these precepts.
<br>6. You are doing yourself violence, violence, my <span property="psy-body">soul</span>; and you will have
no second occasion to do yourself <span property="justice">honour</span>. Brief is the life of each of us, and
this of yours is nearly ended, and yet you do not reverence yourself, but
commit your well-being to the charge of other men’s <span property="psy-body">souls</span>.
<br>7. Do things from outside break in to distract you? Give yourself a time of
quiet to learn some new good thing and cease to wander out of your course.
But, when you have done that, be on your guard against a second kind of
wandering. For those who are <span property="death">sick</span> to <span property="death">death</span> in life, with no mark on which
they direct every <span property="psy-body">impulse</span> or in general every imagination, are triflers, not in
words only but also in their deeds.
<br>8. Men are not easily seen to be brought into evil case by failure to consider
what passes in another’s <span property="psy-body">soul</span>; but they who do not read aright the motions
of their own <span property="psy-body">soul</span> are bound to be in evil case.
<br>9. Always remember the following: what the <span property="nature">nature</span> of the <span property="nature">Whole</span> is; what
my own <span property="nature">nature</span>; the relation of this <span property="nature">nature</span> to that; what kind of part it is of
what kind of <span property="nature">Whole</span>; and that no man can hinder your saying and doing at
all times what is in accordance with that <span property="nature">Nature</span> whereof you are a part.
<br>10. Like a true philosopher Theophrastus says, when comparing, as men
commonly do compare, various faults, that errors of appetite are graver than
errors of temper. For clearly one who loses his temper is turning away from
<span property="reason">Reason</span> with a kind of pain and inward spasm; whereas he who offends
through appetite is the victim of pleasure and is clearly more vicious in a
way and more effeminate in his wrong-doing. Rightly then and in a truly
philosophic spirit Theophrastus said that an offence attended with pleasure
involves greater censure than one attended with pain. And, generally, the
latter resembles more a man who was originally wronged and so is forced
by pain to lose his temper; the other has begun it himself and has been
impelled to do wrong, carried away by appetite to do what he does.
<br>11. In the conviction that it is possible you may depart from life at once, act
and speak and think in every case accordingly. But to leave the company of
men is nothing to fear, if <span property="providence">gods</span> exist;
for they would not involve you in ill.
If, however, they do not exist or if they take no care for man’s affairs, why
should I go on living in a world void of <span property="providence">gods</span>, or void of <span property="providence">providence</span>? But
they do exist, and they do care for men’s lives, and they have put it entirely
in a man’s <span property="power">power</span> not to fall into real ills; for the rest, if anything were an ill,
they would have provided also for this, that it may be in every man’s <span property="power">power</span>
not to fall into it; (and how could what does not make a man worse make
his life worse?) But the <span property="nature">nature</span> of the <span property="nature">Whole</span> would not have winked at these
things either out of <span property="reason">ignorance</span> or because (though it knew of them) it had
not the <span property="power">power</span> to guard against them or to put them right; neither would it
have made so vast an error, from want of <span property="power">power</span> or skill, as to permit good
and ill to befall indifferently, both good and bad men equally. Now <span property="death">death</span>
and life, good report and evil report, pain and pleasure, wealth and poverty,
these all befall men, good and bad alike, equally, and are themselves neither
right nor wrong: they are therefore neither good nor ill.
<br>12. How all things are vanishing swiftly, bodies themselves in the <span property="nature">Universe</span>
and the memorials of them in Time; what is the character of all things of
sense, and most of all those which attract by the bait of pleasure or terrify
by the threat of pain or are shouted abroad by vanity, how cheap,
comtemptible, soiled, corruptible, and mortal: these are for the faculty of
<span property="reason">mind</span> to consider. To consider too what kind of men those are whose
judgements and voices confer <span property="justice">honour</span> and dishonour; what it is to die, and
that if a man looks at it by itself and by the separating activity of thought
strips off all the images associated with <span property="death">death</span>, he will come to judge it to be
nothing else but <span property="nature">Nature</span>’s handiwork. But if a man fears <span property="nature">Nature</span>’s handiwork
he is a mere child; and yet <span property="death">death</span> is not merely <span property="nature">Nature</span>’s handiwork, but also
her well-being. To consider also how mortal man touches <span property="providence">God</span> and through
what organ of himself, and when that part of him is in what sort of
condition.
<br>13. Nothing is more wretched than the man who goes round and round
everything, and, as Pindar says,
‘searches the bowels of the earth’, and
seeks by conjecture to sound the minds of his neighbours, but fails to
perceive that it is enough to abide with the <span property="providence">Divinity</span> that is within himself
and to do Him genuine service. Now that service is to keep Him unsullied
by passion, trifling, and discontent with what comes from <span property="providence">God</span> or men.
What comes from the <span property="providence">Gods</span> is to be revered because of excellence; what
comes from men is dear because they are of one kindred with himself;
pitiful too sometimes, humanly speaking, by <span property="reason">reason</span> of their <span property="reason">ignorance</span> of
good and ill. This disablement is more grievous than that which robs the
eyes of the <span property="power">power</span> to distinguish light from darkness.
<br>14. Even were you about to live three thousand years or thrice ten
thousand, nevertheless remember this, that no one loses any other life than
this which he is living, nor lives any other than this which he is losing. Thus
the longest and the shortest come to the same thing. For the present is equal
for all, and what is passing is therefore equal: thus what is being lost is
proved to be barely a moment. For a man could lose neither past nor future;
how can one rob him of what he has not got? Always remember, then, these
two things: one, that all things from everlasting are of the same kind, and
are in rotation; and it matters nothing whether it be for a hundred years or
for two hundred or for an infinite time that a man shall behold the same
spectacle; the other, that the longest-lived and the soonest to die have an
equal loss; for it is the present alone of which either will be deprived, since
(as we saw) this is all he has and a man does not lose what he has not got.
<br>15. ‘Everything is what you judge it to be.’ While the retort made to the
Cynic philosopher Monimus is plain enough, plain too is the use of the
saying, if one only take the gist of it, so far as it is true.
<br>16. The <span property="psy-body">soul</span> of a man does violence to itself, first and foremost when it
becomes so far as in it lies, a separate growth, a blain as it were upon the
<span property="nature">Universe</span>. For to turn against anything that comes to pass is a separation
from <span property="nature">Nature</span>, by which the natures of each of the rest are severally
comprehended. Secondly, when it turns away from any human being or is
swept counter to him, meaning to injure him, as is the case with the natures
of those who are enraged. It violates itself, thirdly, when it is the victim of
pleasure or pain; fourthly, when it acts a part, and says or does anything
both feignedly and falsely. Fifthly, when, failing to direct any act or <span property="psy-body">impulse</span>
of its own upon a mark, it behaves in any <span property="nature">matter</span> without a plan or
conscious purpose, whereas even the smallest act ought to have a reference
to the end. Now the end of reasonable creatures is this: to obey the rule and
ordinance of the most venerable of all cities and governments.
<br>17. Of a man’s life, his time is a point, his existence a flux, his sensation
clouded, his <span property="psy-body">body</span>’s entire composition corruptible, his <span property="psy-body">vital spirit</span> an eddy
of breath, his <span property="providence">fortune</span> hard to predict, his fame uncertain. Briefly, all the
things of the <span property="psy-body">body</span>, a river; all the things of the spirit, dream and delirium;
his life a warfare and a sojourn in a strange land, his after-fame oblivion.
What then can be his escort through life? One thing and one thing only.
Philosophy. And this is to keep the spirit within him unwronged and
unscathed, master of pains and pleasures, doing nothing at random, nothing
falsely and with pretence; needing no other to do aught or to leave aught
undone; and moreover accepting what befalls it, that is, what is assigned to
it, as coming from the other world from which it came itself. And in all
things awaiting <span property="death">death</span>, with a <span property="reason">mind</span> that is satisfied, counting it nothing else
than a release of the elements from which each living creature is composed.
Now if there is no hurt to the elements themselves in their ceaseless
changing each into other, why should a man apprehend anxiously the
change and <span property="death">dissolution</span> of them all? For this is according to <span property="nature">Nature</span>; and no
evil is according to <span property="nature">Nature</span>. </p>
        </div>
        
    <div id="content3">
    <p><br>1. We ought to take into account not only the fact that day by day life is
being spent and a smaller balance remaining, but this further point also that,
should we live longer, it is at least doubtful whether the intellect will
hereafter be the same, still sufficient to comprehend events and the
speculation which contributes to the understanding alike of things divine
and human. For, if the <span property="reason">mind</span> begin to decay, there will be no failure of
functions like transpiration, nutrition, sense-impression, and desire; but the
right <span property="power">employment</span> of ourselves, precision in regard to the related elements
of duty, analysis of the indications of sense, to know just whether the time
is come to take leave of life, and all questions of the kind which specially
require a trained <span property="reason">judgement</span>— these are extinguished before the rest.
Accordingly we must press forward, not only because every day we are
drawing nearer to <span property="death">death</span>, but also because the apprehension of events and
the ability to adapt ourselves to them begin to wane before the end.
<br>2. We must also observe closely points of this kind, that even the
secondary effects of Nature’s processes possess a sort of grace and
attraction. To take one instance, bread when it is being baked breaks open at
some places; now even these cracks, which in one way contradict the
promise of the baker’s art, somehow catch the eye and stimulate in a special
way our appetite for the food. And again figs, when fully mature, gape, and
in ripe olives their very approach to decay adds a certain beauty of its own
to the fruit. Ears of corn too when they bend downwards, the lion’s
wrinkled brow, the foam flowing from the boar’s mouth, and many other
characteristics that are far from beautiful if we look at them in isolation, do
nevertheless because they follow from Nature’s processes lend those a
further ornament and a fascination. And so, if a man has a feeling for, and a
deeper insight into the processes of the <span property="nature">Universe</span>, there is hardly one but
will somehow appear to present itself pleasantly to him, even among mere
attendant circumstances. Such a man also will feel no less pleasure in
looking at the actual jaws of wild beasts than at the imitations which
painters and sculptors exhibit, and he will be enabled to see in an old
woman or an old man a kind of freshness and bloom, and to look upon the
charms of his own boy slaves with sober eyes. And many such experiences
there will be, not convincing to everyone but occurring to him and to him
alone who has become genuinely familiar with Nature and her works.
<br>3. Hippocrates, after curing many sicknesses, himself fell <span property="death">sick</span> and died.
The Chaldean astrologers foretold the <span property="death">death</span> of many persons, then the
hour of <span property="providence">fate</span> overtook them also. Alexander, Pompeius, and Julius Caesar,
after so often utterly destroying whole towns and slaying in the field many
myriads of horse and foot, themselves also one day departed from life.
Heraclitus, after many speculations about the fire which should consume
the <span property="nature">Universe</span>, was waterlogged by dropsy, poulticed himself with cow-dung,
and died. Vermin killed Democritus; another kind of vermin Socrates.
What is the moral? You went on board, you set sail, you have made the
port. Step ashore: if to a second life, nothing is void of <span property="providence">gods</span>, not even in
that other world; but if to unconsciousness, you will cease to suffer pains
and pleasures and to be the servant of an earthly vessel as far inferior as that
which does it service is superior; for the one is <span property="reason">mind</span> and deity, the other
clay and gore.
<br>4. Do not waste the balance of life left to you in thoughts about other
persons, when you are not referring to some advantage of your fellows—for
why do you rob yourself of something else which you might do—I mean if
you imagine to yourself what so and so is doing, and why; what he is saying
or thinking or planning, and every thought of the kind which leads you
astray from close watch over your <span property="power">governing self</span>?
Rather you must, in the train of your thoughts, avoid what is merely casual
and without purpose, and above all curiosity and malice; you must habituate
yourself only to thoughts about which if someone were suddenly to ask:
‘What is in your <span property="reason">mind</span> now?’, you would at once reply, quite frankly, this or
that; and so from the answer it would immediately be plain that all was
simplicity and kindness, the thoughts of a social being, who disregards
pleasurable, or to speak more generally luxurious imaginings or rivalry of
any kind, or envy and suspicion or anything else about which you would
blush to put into words that you had it in your head.
A man so minded, putting off no longer to be one of the elect, is surely a
priest and minister of <span property="providence">gods</span>, employing aright that which is seated within
him, which makes the mere mortal to be unstained by pleasures, unscathed
by any pain, untouched by any wrong, unconscious of any wickedness; a
wrestler in the greatest contest of all, not to be overthrown by any passion;
dyed with <span property="justice">justice</span> to the core, welcoming with his whole heart all that comes
to pass and is assigned to him; seldom and only under some great <span property="nature">necessity</span>
and for the common good imagining what another person is saying or doing
or thinking. For he has only his own work to realize and he keeps in <span property="reason">mind</span>
continually what is assigned to him from the <span property="nature">Whole</span>; his work he makes
perfect, his lot he is convinced is good; for the birth-spirit assigned to every
man goes with him and carries him along with it.
Moreover, he remembers that all reasonable beings are akin to himself, and
that although to care for all men is in accord with man’s nature, he is to
cling not to the opinion of all men, but only of men who live in accord with
Nature. Indeed, he remembers continually what those who do not so live are
like, in their homes and abroad, by night and by day; what manner of men
they are, and those with whom they defile themselves. Therefore he takes
no account even of the praise of such men-men who are not even acceptable
to themselves.
<br>5. Do not act unwillingly nor selfishly nor without self-examination, nor
with divergent motives. Let no affectation veneer your thinking. Be neither
a busy talker, nor a busybody. Moreover let the <span property="providence">God</span> within be the guardian
of a real man, a man of ripe years, a statesman, a Roman, a magistrate,
who has taken his post like one waiting for the Retreat to sound, ready to
depart, needing no oath nor any man as witness. And see that you have
gladness of face, no need of service from without nor the peace that other
men bestow. You should stand upright,
 not be held upright.
<br>6. If you discover in the life of man something higher than <span property="justice">justice</span>, <span property="reason">truth</span>,
<span property="justice">temperance</span>, fortitude, and generally speaking than your understanding
contented with itself, where it presents you behaving by the rule of right,
and satisfied with destiny, in what is assigned to you and is not yours to
choose; if, I say, you see something higher than this, turn to it with all your
heart and enjoy the supreme good now that it is found. But if nothing higher
is revealed than the very <span property="providence">divinity</span> seated within you, subordinating your
private impulses to itself, examining your thoughts, having withdrawn
itself, as Socrates used to say,
 from the sense-affections, and subordinated
itself to the <span property="providence">gods</span> and making men its first care; if you find all else to be
smaller and cheaper than this, give no room to anything else, to which when
once you incline and turn, you will no longer have the <span property="power">power</span> without a
struggle to prefer in <span property="justice">honour</span> that which is your own, your peculiar good. For
it is not right to set up a rival of another kind to the good of <span property="reason">Reason</span> and of
the Commonwealth; the praise of the multitude, for example, or place or
wealth or pleasurable indulgence. All these, though they appear for a little
while to be in accord, suddenly gain the mastery and carry a man away. Do
you then, I say, simply and of your own free will, choose the higher and
hold fast to that. ‘But the higher is what is to our advantage’;
if to the
advantage of a reasonable being, keep hold of that, but if to the advantage
of a mere animate creature, say so and preserve your decision without
parade; only see to it that you make a choice that will not betray you.
<br>7. Never value as an advantage to yourself what will force you one day to
break your word, to abandon self-respect, to hate, suspect, execrate another,
to act a part, to covet anything that calls for walls or coverings to conceal it.
A man who puts first his own <span property="reason">mind</span> and <span property="providence">divinity</span>, and the holy rites of its
excellence, makes no scene, utters no groans, will need neither the refuge of
solitude nor the crowded streets. What is most worthwhile, he will pass his
days neither in pursuit nor in avoidance, and it is no concern at all of his
whether the time be longer or shorter for which he shall have the use of the
<span property="psy-body">soul</span> in its bodily envelope; for even if he must be released at once, he will
depart as easily as he would perform any other act that can be done with
reverence and sobriety, being careful all his life of this one thing alone that
his understanding be not found in any state which is foreign to a reasonable
social being.
<br>8. In the understanding of a man of chastened and purified spirit you will
find no trace of festering wound, no ulceration, no abscess beneath the skin.
The hour of <span property="providence">fate</span> does not surprise his life before its fulfilment, so that one
would say that the actor is leaving the stage before he has fulfilled his role,
before the play is over. You will find nothing servile or artificial, no
dependence on others nor severance from them; nothing to account for,
nothing that needs a hole to hide in.
<br>9. Reverence your faculty of <span property="reason">judgement</span>. On this it entirely rests that your
<span property="power">governing self</span> no longer has a <span property="reason">judgement</span> disobedient to Nature and to the
estate of a reasonable being. This <span property="reason">judgement</span> promises deliberateness,
familiar friendship with men, and to follow in the train of the <span property="providence">gods</span>.
<br>10. Therefore throw all else aside, and hold fast only these few things;
further calling to <span property="reason">mind</span> at the same time that each of us lives only in the
present, this brief moment; the rest is either a life that is past, or is in an
uncertain future. Little the life each lives, little the corner of the earth he
lives in, little even the longest fame hereafter, and even that dependent on
a succession of poor mortals, who will very soon be dead, and have not
learnt to know themselves, much less the man who was dead long years
ago.
<br>11. To the above supports let one more be added. Always make a figure or
outline of the imagined object as it occurs, in order to see distinctly what it
is in its essence, naked, as a whole and parts; and say to yourself its
individual name and the names of the things of which it was compounded
and into which it will be broken up. For nothing is so able to create
greatness of <span property="reason">mind</span> as the <span property="power">power</span> methodically and truthfully to test each
thing that meets one in life, and always to look upon it so as to attend at the
same time to the use which this particular thing contributes to a <span property="nature">Universe</span> of
a certain definite kind, what value it has in reference to the <span property="nature">Whole</span>, and
what to man, who is a citizen of the highest City, whereof all other cities are
like households. What is this which now creates an image in me, what is its
composition? how long will it naturally continue, what virtue is of use to
meet it; for example, gentleness, fortitude, <span property="reason">truth</span>, good faith, simplicity, selfreliance, and the rest? Therefore, in each case, we must say: this has come
from <span property="providence">God</span>; this by the actual co-ordination of events, the complicated web
and similar coincidence or chance; this again from my fellow man, my
kinsman, my comrade, yet one who does not know what is natural for
himself But I do know; wherefore I use him kindly and justly, according to
the natural <span property="nature">law</span> of fellowship, aiming, however, at the same time at his
desert, where the question is morally indifferent.
<br>12. If you complete the present work, following the rule of right, earnestly,
with all your might, with kindness, and admit no side issue, but preserve
your own <span property="providence">divinity</span> pure and erect, as if you have this moment to restore it; if
you make this secure, expecting nothing and avoiding nothing, but content
with present <span property="justice">action</span> in accord with Nature and with heroic <span property="reason">truth</span> in what you
mean and say, you will live the blessed life. Now there is no one who is
able to prevent this.
<br>13. As doctors have their instruments and scalpels always at hand to meet
sudden demands for treatment, so do you have your doctrines ready in order
to recognize the divine and human, and so to do everything, even the very
smallest, as mindful of the bond which unites the divine and human; for you
will not do any act well which concerns man without referring it to the
divine; and the same is true of your conduct to <span property="providence">God</span>.
<br>14. Do not wander from your path any longer, for you are not likely to read
your notebooks or your deeds of ancient Rome and Greece or your extracts
from their writings, which you laid up against old age. Hasten then to the
goal, lay idle hopes aside, and come to your own help, if you care at all for
yourself, while still you may.
<br>15. They have not learnt to know the manifold significance of theft, of
sowing, of buying, resting, seeing what ought to be done. This depends not
on the bodily eye but on another kind of vision.
<br>16. <span property="psy-body">Body</span>, <span property="psy-body">vital spirit</span>, <span property="reason">mind</span>: of the <span property="psy-body">body</span>, sense perceptions; of the vital
spirit, impulses; of the <span property="reason">mind</span>, doctrines. To be impressed by images belongs
also to the beasts of the field, to be swayed by the strings of <span property="psy-body">impulse</span> to wild
beasts, to men who sin against nature, to a Phalaris or a Nero. To have
the <span property="reason">mind</span> as guide to what appear to be duties belongs also to men who do
not believe in <span property="providence">gods</span>, who betray their own country, who do anything and
everything once they have locked their doors. If then all else is common
to you with those whom I have mentioned, it remains the peculiar mark of
the good man to love and welcome what befalls him and is the thread <span property="providence">fate</span>
spins for him; not to soil the <span property="providence">divinity</span> seated within his breast nor to disquiet
it with a mob of imaginations, but to preserve and to propitiate it, following
<span property="providence">God</span> in orderly wise, uttering no word contrary to <span property="reason">truth</span>, doing no act
contrary to <span property="justice">justice</span>. And if all men disbelieve that he lives simply, modestly,
and cheerfully, he is not angry with any one of them nor diverted from the
road that leads to the goal of his life, at which he must arrive, pure,
peaceful, ready to depart, in effortless accord with his own birth-spirit. </p>

<p><br>1. The sovereign <span property="power">power</span> within, in its natural state, so confronts what
comes to pass as always to adapt itself readily to what is feasible and is
presented to it. This is because it puts its affection upon no material of its
own choice; rather it sets itself upon its objects with a reservation, and then
makes the opposition which encounters it into material for itself It is like a
fire, when it masters what falls into it, whereby a little taper would have
been put out, but a bright fire very quickly appropriates and devours what is
heaped upon it, and leaps up higher out of those very obstacles.
<br>2. Nothing that is undertaken is to be undertaken without a purpose, nor
otherwise than according to a <span property="reason">principle</span> which makes the art of living
perfect.
<br>3. Men look for retreats for themselves, the country, the seashore, the hills;
and you yourself, too, are peculiarly accustomed to feel the same want. Yet
all this is very unlike a philosopher, when you may at any hour you please
retreat into yourself. For nowhere does a man retreat into more quiet or
more privacy than into his own <span property="reason">mind</span>, especially one who has within such
things that he has only to look into, and become at once in perfect ease; and
by ease I mean nothing else but good behaviour. Continually, therefore,
grant yourself this retreat and repair yourself. But let them be brief and
fundamental truths, which will suffice at once by their presence to wash
away all sorrow, and to send you back without repugnance to the life to
which you return.
For what is it that shall move your repugnance? The wickedness of men?
Recall the <span property="reason">judgement</span> that reasonable creatures have come into the world for
the sake of one another; that patience is a part of <span property="justice">justice</span>; that men do wrong
involuntarily; and how many at last, after enmity, suspicion, hatred,
warfare, have been laid out on their <span property="death">death</span>-beds and come to dust. This
should make you pause. But shall what is assigned from Universal <span property="nature">Nature</span>
be repugnant to you? Revive the alternative: ‘either <span property="providence">Providence</span> or blind
<span property="providence">atoms</span>’,
 and the many proofs that the <span property="nature">Universe</span> is a kind of Commonwealth.
Shall then the things of the <span property="psy-body">flesh</span> still have hold upon you? Reflect that the
understanding, when once it takes control of itself and recognizes its own
<span property="power">power</span>, does not mingle with the <span property="psy-body">vital spirit</span>, be its current smooth or broken,
and finally reflect upon all that you have heard and consented to about pain
and pleasure.
Well, then, shall mere <span property="power">glory</span> distract you? Look at the swiftness of the
oblivion of all men; the gulf of endless time, behind and before; the
hollowness of applause, the fickleness and folly of those who seem to speak
well of you, and the narrow room in which it is confined. This should make
you pause. For the entire earth is a point in space, and how small a corner
thereof is this your dwelling place, and how few and how paltry those who
will sing your praises here!
Finally, therefore, remember your retreat into this little domain which is
yourself, and above all be not disturbed nor on the rack, but be free and
look at things as a man, a human being, a citizen, a creature that must die.
And among what is most ready to hand into which you will look have these
two: the one, that things do not take hold upon the <span property="reason">mind</span>, but stand without
unmoved, and that disturbances come only from the <span property="reason">judgement</span> within; the
second, that all that your eyes behold will change in a moment and be no
more; and of how many things you have already witnessed the changes,
think continually of that.
The <span property="nature">Universe</span> is change, life is opinion.
<br>4. If <span property="reason">mind</span> is common to us all, then also the <span property="reason">reason</span>, whereby we are
reasoning beings, is common. If this be so, then also the <span property="reason">reason</span> which
enjoins what is to be done or left undone is common. If this be so, <span property="nature">law</span> also
is common; if this be so, we are citizens; if this be so, we are partakers in
one constitution; if this be so, the <span property="nature">Universe</span> is a kind of Commonwealth. For
in what other common government can we say that the whole race of men
partakes? And thence, from this common City, is derived our <span property="reason">mind</span> itself,
our <span property="reason">reason</span> and our sense of <span property="nature">law</span>, or from what else? For as the earthy is in
me a portion from some earth, and the watery from a second element, and
the <span property="psy-body">vital spirit</span> from some source, and the hot and fiery from yet another
source of its own (for nothing comes from nothing, just as nothing returns
to nothing), so therefore the <span property="reason">mind</span> also has come from some source.
<br>5. <span property="death">Death</span> is like birth, a mystery of <span property="nature">Nature</span>; a coming together out of
identical elements and a <span property="death">dissolution</span> into the same. Looked at generally this
is not a thing of which man should be ashamed, for it is contrary neither to
what is conformable to a reasonable creature nor to the <span property="reason">principle</span> of his
constitution.
<br>6. These are natural and necessary results from creatures of this kind, and
one who wants this to be otherwise wants the fig tree not to yield its acrid
juice. And in general remember this, that within a very little while both he
and you will be dead, and a little after not even your name nor his will be
left.
<br>7. Get rid of the <span property="reason">judgement</span>; you are rid of the ‘I am hurt’; get rid of the ‘I
am hurt’, you are rid of the hurt itself.
<br>8. What does not make a man worse than he was, neither makes his life
worse than it was, nor hurts him without or within.
<br>9. It was a <span property="nature">law</span> of <span property="nature">necessity</span> that what is naturally beneficial should bring
this about.
<br>10. ‘All that comes to pass comes to pass with <span property="justice">justice</span>.’ You will find this to
be so if you watch carefully. I do not mean only in accordance with the
ordered series of events, but in accordance with <span property="justice">justice</span> and as it were by
someone who assigns what has respect to worth. Watch, therefore, as you
have begun and whatever you do, do it with this, with goodness in the
specific sense in which the notion of the good man is conceived. Preserve
this goodness in everything you do.
<br>11. Don’t regard things in the light in which he who does the wrong judges
them, nor as he wishes you to judge them: but see them as in <span property="reason">truth</span> they are.
<br>12. In these two ways you must always be prepared: the one, only to act as
the <span property="reason">principle</span> of the royal and <span property="nature">law</span>-giving art prescribes for the benefit of
mankind; the second, to change your purpose, if someone is there to correct
and to guide you away from some fancy of yours
. The guidance must,
however, always be from a conviction of <span property="justice">justice</span> or common benefit
ensuing, and what you prefer must be similar, not because it looked pleasant
or popular.
<br>13. ‘You have <span property="reason">reason</span>?’ ‘Yes, I have?’ ‘Why not use it then? If this is doing
its part, what else do you want?’
<br>14. You came into the world as a part. You will vanish in that which gave
you birth, or rather you will be taken up into its generative <span property="reason">reason</span> by the
process of change.
<br>15. Many grains of incense upon the same altar; one falls first, another later,
but difference there is none.
<br>16. Within ten days you will appear a <span property="providence">god</span> even to those11
to whom today
you seem a beast or a baboon, if you return to your principles and your
reverence of the Word.
<br>17. Don’t live as though you were going to live a myriad years. <span property="providence">Fate</span> is
hanging over your head; while you have life, while you may, become good.
<br>18. How great a rest from labour he gains who does not look to what his
neighbour says or does or thinks,
 but only to what he himself is doing, in
order that exactly this may be just and holy, or in accord with a good man’s
conduct. ‘Do not look round at a black character’, but run towards the
goal, balanced, not throwing your <span property="psy-body">body</span> about.
<br>19. The man in a flutter for after-fame fails to picture to himself that each of
those who remember him will himself also very shortly die, then again the
man who succeeded him, until the whole remembrance is extinguished as it
runs along a line of men who are kindled and then put out. And put the case
that those who will remember never die, and the remembrance never dies,
what is that to you! And I do not say that it is nothing to the dead; what is
praise to the living, except perhaps for some practical purpose? For now
you are putting off unseasonably the gift of <span property="nature">Nature</span>, which does not depend
on the testimony of some one else . . .
<br>20. Everything in any way lovely is of itself and terminates in itself, holding
praise to be no part of itself. At all events, in no case does what is praised
become better or worse. This I say also of what is commonly called lovely,
for instance materials and work of art; and indeed what is there lacking at
all to that which is really lovely? No more than to <span property="nature">law</span>, no more than to
<span property="reason">truth</span>, no more than to kindness or reverence of self. Which of these is
lovely because it is praised or corrupted because it is blamed? Does an
emerald become worse than it was, if it be not praised? And what of gold,
ivory, purple, a lute, a sword-blade, a flower-bud, and little plant?
<br>21. You ask how, if <span property="psy-body">souls</span> continue to exist, the atmosphere has room for
them from time external. But how does the ground have room for the bodies
of those who for so long an age are buried in it? The answer is that, as on
earth change and <span property="death">dissolution</span> after a continuance for so long make room for
other dead bodies, so in the atmosphere <span property="psy-body">souls</span> pass on and continue for so
long, and then change and are poured out and are kindled being assumed
into the generative <span property="reason">principle</span> of Universal <span property="nature">Nature</span>, and so provide room for
those which succeed to their place. This would be the answer presuming
that <span property="psy-body">souls</span> do continue. But we must consider not only the multitude of
bodies that are thus buried, but also the number of animals eaten every day
by ourselves and the rest of the animal creation. How large a number are
devoured and in a manner of speaking buried in the bodies of those who
feed upon them; and yet there is room to contain them because they are
turned into blood, because they are changed into forms of air and heat. How
shall we investigate the <span property="reason">truth</span> of this? By a distinction into the material and
the causal.
<br>22. Do not wander without a purpose, but in all your impulses render what
is just, and in all your imaginations preserve what you apprehend.
<br>23. Everything is fitting for me, my <span property="nature">Universe</span>, which fits thy purpose.
Nothing in thy good time is too early or too late for me; everything is fruit
for me which thy seasons. <span property="nature">Nature</span>, bear; from thee, in thee, to thee are all
things. The poet sings: ‘Dear city of Cecrops’, and will you not say: ‘Dear
city of <span property="providence">God</span>’?
<br>24. Democritus has said: ‘Do few things, if you would enjoy tranquillity’.
May it not be better to do the necessary things and what the <span property="reason">reason</span> of a
creature intended by <span property="nature">Nature</span> to be social prescribes, and as that <span property="reason">reason</span>
prescribes? For this brings not only the tranquillity from doing right but
also from doing few things. For if one removes most of what we say and do
as unnecessary, he will have more leisure and less interruption. Wherefore
on each occasion he should remind himself: ‘Is this not one of the necessary
things?’ <Democritus> And he should remove not actions merely that are unnecessary, but
imaginations also, for in this way superfluous actions too will not follow in
their train.
<br>25. Make trial for yourself how the life of the good man, too, fares well, of
the man pleased with what is assigned from Universal <span property="nature">Nature</span> and contented
by his own just <span property="justice">action</span> and kind disposition.
<br>26. You have seen those things, look now at these: do not trouble yourself,
make yourself simple. Does a man do wrong? He does wrong to himself.
Has some chance befallen you? It is well; from Universal <span property="nature">Nature</span>, from the
beginning, all that befalls was determined for you and the thread was
spun. The sum of the <span property="nature">matter</span> is this: life is short; the present must be
turned to profit with reasonableness and right. Be sober without effort.
<br>27. Either an ordered <span property="nature">Universe</span> or a medley heaped together mechanically
but still an order; or can order subsist in you and disorder in the <span property="nature">Whole</span>!
And that, too, when all things are so distinguished and yet intermingled and
sympathetic.
<br>28. A black heart is an unmanly heart, a stubborn heart; resembling a
beast of prey, a mere brute, or a child; foolish, crafty, ribald, mercenary,
despotic.
<br>29. If he is a foreigner in the <span property="nature">Universe</span> who does not recognize the essence
of the <span property="nature">Universe</span>, no less is he a foreigner, who does not recognize what
comes to pass in it. A fugitive is he who runs away from the reasonable <span property="nature">law</span>
of his City; a blind man, he who shuts the eye of the <span property="reason">mind</span>; a beggar, he who
has need of another and has not all that is necessary for life in himself; a
blain on the <span property="nature">Universe</span>, he who rebels and separates himself from the <span property="reason">reason</span>
of our common <span property="nature">nature</span> because he is displeased with what comes to pass
(for <span property="nature">Nature</span> who bore you, brings these things also into being); a fragment
cut off from the City, he who cuts off his own <span property="psy-body">soul</span> from the <span property="psy-body">soul</span> of
reasonable creatures, which is one.
<br>30. Here is a philosopher without a tunic, another without a book, another
here half-naked. ‘I have no bread,’ he says, ‘still I stand firm by the Word.’
And I have nourishment from my lessons and yet do not stand firm.
<br>31. Love the art which you were taught, set up your rest in this. Pass
through what is left of life as one who has committed all that is yours, with
your whole heart, to the <span property="providence">gods</span>, and of men making yourself neither despot
nor servant to any.
<br>32. Call to <span property="reason">mind</span> by way of example the time of Vespasian: you will see
everything the same: men marrying, bringing up children, falling ill, dying,
fighting, feasting, trading, farming, flattering, asserting themselves,
suspecting, plotting, praying for another’s <span property="death">death</span>, murmuring at the present,
lusting, heaping up riches, setting their heart on offices and thrones. And
now that life of theirs is no more and nowhere.
Again pass on to the time of Trajan; again everything the same. That life,
too, is dead. In like manner contemplate and behold the rest of the records
of times and whole nations; and see how many after their struggles fell in a
little while and were resolved into the elements. But most of all you must
run over in <span property="reason">mind</span> those whom you yourself have known to be distracted in
vain, neglecting to perform what was agreeable to their own constitution, to
hold fast to this and to be content with this. And here you are bound to
remember that the attention paid to each <span property="justice">action</span> has its own worth and
proportion; only so you will not be dejected if in smaller matters you are
occupied no farther than was appropriate.
<br>33. Words familiar in olden times are now archaisms; so also the names of
those whose praises were hymned in bygone days are now in a sense
archaisms; Camillus, Caeso, Volesus, Dentatus; a little after, Scipio too
and Cato; then also Augustus, then also Hadrian and Antoninus. For all
things quickly fade and turn to fable, and quickly, too, utter oblivion covers
them like sand. And this I say of those who shone like stars to wonder at;
the rest, as soon as the breath was out of their bodies, were ‘unnoticed and
unwept’<Homer>. And what after all is everlasting remembrance? Utter vanity.
What then is that about which a man ought to spend his pains? This one
thing; right understanding, neighbourly behaviour, speech which would
never lie, and a disposition welcoming all which comes to pass, as
necessary, as familiar, as flowing from a source and fountain like itself.
<br>34. With your whole will surrender yourself to Clotho to spin your <span property="providence">fate</span> into
whatever web of things she will.
<br>35. All is ephemeral, both what remembers and what is remembered.
<br>36. Contemplate continually all things coming to pass by change, and
accustom yourself to think that Universal <span property="nature">Nature</span> loves nothing so much as
to change what is and to create new things in their likeness. For everything
that is, is in a way the seed of what will come out of it, whereas you
imagine seeds to be only those which are cast into the earth or into the
womb. But that is very unscientific.
<br>37. You will presently be dead and are not yet simple, untroubled, void of
suspicion that anything from outside can hurt you, not yet propitious to all
men, nor counting wisdom to consist only in just <span property="justice">action</span>.
<br>38. Look into their governing principles, even the wise among them, what
petty things they avoid and what pursue!
<br>39. Your evil does not consist in another’s governing <span property="reason">principle</span>, nor indeed
in any change and alteration of your environment. Where then? Where the
part of you which judges about evil is. Let it not frame the <span property="reason">judgement</span>, and
all is well. Even if what is nearest to it, your <span property="psy-body">body</span>, is cut, cauterized,
suppurates, mortifies, still let the part which judges about these things be at
rest; that is, let it decide that nothing is good or evil which can happen
indifferently to the evil man and the good. For what happens indifferently to
one whose life is contrary to <span property="nature">Nature</span> and to one whose life is according to
<span property="nature">Nature</span>, this is neither according to nor contrary to <span property="nature">Nature</span>.
<br>40. Constantly think of the <span property="nature">Universe</span> as one living creature, embracing one
being and one <span property="psy-body">soul</span>; how all is absorbed into the one consciousness of this
living creature; how it compasses all things with a single purpose, and how
all things work together to cause all that comes to pass, and their wonderful
web and texture.
<br>41. You are a spirit bearing the weight of a dead <span property="psy-body">body</span>, as Epictetus used to
say. <Epictetus>

<br>42. For what comes to pass in the course of change nothing is evil, as
nothing is good for what exists in consequence of change.
<br>43. There is a kind of river of things passing into being, and Time is a
violent torrent. For no sooner is each seen, then it has been carried away,
and another is being carried by, and that, too, will be carried away.
<br>44. All that comes to pass is as familiar and well known as the rose in
spring and the grape in summer. Of like fashion are sickness, <span property="death">death</span>,
calumny, intrigue, and all that gladdens or saddens the foolish.
<br>45. What follows is always organically related to what went before; for it is
not like a simple enumeration of units separately determined by <span property="nature">necessity</span>,
but a rational combination; and as Being is arranged in a mutual coordination, so the phenomena of Becoming display no bare succession but a
wonderful organic interrelation.
<br>46. Always remember what Heraclitus said: ‘the <span property="death">death</span> of earth is the birth
of water, the <span property="death">death</span> of water is the birth of atmosphere, the <span property="death">death</span> of
atmosphere is fire, and conversely’<Heraclitus> Remember, too, his image of the man
who forgets the way he is going; and: ‘they are at variance with that with
which they most continuously have converse (<span property="reason">Reason</span> which governs the
<span property="nature">Universe</span>), and the things they meet with every day appear alien to them’;
and again: ‘we must not act and speak like men who sleep, for in sleep we
suppose that we act and speak’; and ‘we must not be like children with
parents’<Heraclitus>, that is, accept things simply as we have received them.
<br>47. Just as, if one of the <span property="providence">gods</span> told you: ‘tomorrow you will be dead or in
any case the day after tomorrow’, you would no longer be making that day
after important any more than tomorrow, unless you are an arrant coward
(for the difference is a mere trifle), in the same way count it no great <span property="nature">matter</span>
to live to a year that is an infinite distance off rather than till tomorrow.
<br>48. Think continually how many physicians have died, after often knitting
their foreheads over their patients; how many astrologers after prophesying
other men’s <span property="death">deaths</span>, as though to die were a great <span property="nature">matter</span>; how many
philosophers after endless debate on <span property="death">death</span> or survival after <span property="death">death</span>; how
many paladins after slaying their thousands; how many tyrants after using
their <span property="power">power</span> over men’s lives with monstrous arrogance, as if themselves
immortal; how many entire cities have, if I may use the term, died,
Helice, Pompeii, Herculaneum, and others innumerable. Run over, too, the
many also you know of, one after another. One followed this man’s funeral
and then was himself laid on the bier; another followed him, and all in a
little while. This is the whole <span property="nature">matter</span>: see always how ephemeral and cheap
are the things of man—yesterday, a spot of albumen, tomorrow, ashes or a
mummy. Therefore make your passage through this span of time in
obedience to <span property="nature">Nature</span> and gladly lay down your life, as an olive, when ripe,
might fall, blessing her who bare it and grateful to the tree which gave it
life.
<br>49. Be like the headland on which the waves continually break, but it stands
firm and about it the boiling waters sink to sleep. ‘Unlucky am I, because
this has befallen me.’ Nay rather: ‘Lucky am I, because, though this befell
me, I continue free from sorrow, neither crushed by the present, nor fearing
what is to come.’ For such an event might have befallen any man, but not
every man would have continued in it free from sorrow. On what grounds
then is this ill <span property="providence">fortune</span> more than that good <span property="providence">fortune</span>? Do you, speaking
generally, call what is not a deviation from man’s <span property="nature">nature</span> a man’s ill <span property="providence">fortune</span>,
and do you suppose that what is not opposed to his natural will is a
deviation from his <span property="nature">nature</span>? Very well, you have been taught what that will
is. Can what has befallen you prevent your being just, high-minded,
temperate, prudent, free from rash judgements, trustful, self-reverent, free,
and whatever else by its presence with him enables a man’s <span property="nature">nature</span> to secure
what is really his? Finally, in every event which leads you to sorrow,
remember to use this <span property="reason">principle</span>: that this is not a misfortune, but that to bear
it like a brave man is good <span property="providence">fortune</span>.
<br>50. An unscientific but none the less a helpful support to disdain of <span property="death">death</span> is
to review those who have clung tenaciously to life. What more did they
gain than those who died prematurely? In every case they are laid in some
grave at last: Caedicianus, Fabius, Julianus, Lepidus, and any others like
them, who after carrying many to the grave were themselves carried out. To
speak generally the difference is a small one, and this difference longdrawn-out through what great toils and with what sorts of men and in how
weak a <span property="psy-body">body</span>. Do not count it then as a thing . . .; for see the gulf of time
behind and another infinite time in front: in this what difference is there
between a three-days-old infant and a Nestor of three generations?
<br>51. Run always the short road, and <span property="nature">Nature</span>’s road is short. Therefore say and
do everything in the soundest way, because a purpose like this delivers a
man from troubles and warfare, from every care and superfluity. </p>
