agreeable also (in social life).

    ns1:containsText """ From my father (by adoption): gentleness and unshaken resolution in
judgements taken after full examination; no vainglory about external
honours; love of work and perseverance; readiness to hear those who had
anything to contribute to the public advantage; the desire to award to every
man according to desert without partiality; the experience that knew where
to tighten the rein, where to relax. Prohibition of unnatural practices,
social tact and permission to his suite not invariably to be present at his
banquets nor to attend his progress from Rome, as a matter of obligation,
and always to be found the same by those who had failed to attend him
through engagements. Exact scrutiny in council and patience; not that he
was avoiding investigation, satisfied with first impressions. An inclination
to keep his friends, and nowhere fastidious or the victim of manias but his
own master in everything, and his outward mien cheerful. His long
foresight and ordering of the merest trifle without making scenes. The
check in his reign put upon organized applause and every form of lipservice; his unceasing watch over the needs of the empire and his
stewardship of its resources; his patience under criticism by individuals of
such conduct. No superstitious fear of divine powers or with man any
courting of the public or obsequiousness or cultivation of popular favour,
but temperance in all things and firmness; nowhere want of taste or search
for novelty.
In the things which contribute to life’s comfort, where Fortune was lavish to
him, use without display and at the same time without apology, so as to take
them when they were there quite simply and not to require them when they
were absent. The fact that no one would have said that he was a sophist, an
impostor, or a pedant, but a ripe man, an entire man, above flattery, able to
preside over his own and his subjects’ business.
Besides all this the inclination to respect genuine followers of philosophy,
but towards the other sort no tendency to reproach nor on the other hand to
be hoodwinked by them; affability, too, and humour, but not to excess. Care
of his health in moderation, not as one in love with living nor with an eye to
personal appearance nor on the other hand neglecting it, but so far as by
attention to self to need doctoring or medicine and external applications for
very few ailments.
A very strong point, to give way without jealousy to those who had some
particular gift like literary expression or knowledge of the Civil Law or
customs or other matters, even sharing their enthusiasm that each might get
the reputation due to his individual excellence. Acting always according to
the tradition of our forefathers, yet not endeavouring that this regard for
tradition should be noticed. No tendency, moreover, to chop and change, but
a settled course in the same places and the same practices. After acute
attacks of headache, fresh and vigorous at once for his accustomed duties;
and not to have many secrets, only very few and by way of exception, and
those solely because of matters of State. Discretion and moderation alike in
the provision of shows, in carrying out public works, in donations to the
populace, and so on; the behaviour in fact of one who has an eye precisely
to what it is his duty to do, not to the reputation which attends the doing.
He was not one who bathed at odd hours, not fond of building, no
connoisseur of the table, of the stuff and colour of his dress, of the beauty of
his slaves. His costume was brought to Rome from his country house at
Lorium; his manner of life at Lanuvium; the way he treated the taxcollector who apologized at Tusculum, and all his behaviour of that sort.
Nowhere harsh, merciless, or blustering, nor so that you might ever say ‘to
fever heat’, but everything nicely calculated and divided into its times, as
by a leisured man; no bustle, complete order, strength, consistency. What is
recorded of Socrates would exactly fit him: he could equally be abstinent
from or enjoy what many are too weak to abstain from and too selfindulgent in enjoying. To be strong, to endure, and in either case to be sober
belong to the man of perfect and invincible spirit, like the spirit of Maximus
in his illness.

sister, good masters, good intimates, kinsfolk, friends, almost everything;
and that in regard to not one of them did I stumble into offence, although I
had the kind of disposition which might in some circumstances have led me
to behave thus; but it was the goodness of the gods that no conjunction of
events came about which was likely to expose my weakness. That I was not
brought up longer than I was with my grandfather’s second wife, that I
preserved the flower of my youth and did not play the man before my time,
but even delayed a little longer. That my station in life was under a
governor and a father who was to strip off all my pride and to lead me to
see that it is possible to live in a palace and yet not to need a bodyguard or
embroidered uniforms or candelabra and statues bearing lamps and the like
accompaniments of pomp, but that one is able to contract very nearly to a
private station and not on that account to lose dignity or to be more remiss
in the duties that a prince must perform on behalf of the public. That I met
with so good a brother,
able by his character not only to rouse me to care
of myself but at the same time to hearten me by respect and natural
affection; that my children were not deficient in mind nor deformed in
body; that I made no further progress in eloquence and poetry and those
other pursuits wherein, had I seen myself progressing along an easy road, I
should perhaps have become absorbed. That I made haste to advance my
masters to the honours which they appeared to covet and did not put them
off with hopes that, as they were still young, I should do it later on. To have
got to know Apollonius, Rusticus, Maximus. To have pictured to myself
clearly and repeatedly what life in obedience to Nature really is, so that,
so far as concerns the gods and communications from the other world, and
aids and inspirations, nothing hinders my living at once in obedience to
Nature, though I still come somewhat short of this by my own fault and by
not observing the reminders and almost the instructions of the gods. That
my body has held out so well in a life like mine; that I did not touch
Benedicta or Theodotus,but that even in later years when I experienced
the passion of love I was cured; that though I was often angry with Rusticus
I never went to extremes for which I should have been sorry; that though
my mother was fated to die young, she still spent her last years with me.
That whenever I wanted to help anyone in poverty or some other necessity I
was never told that I could not afford it, and that I did not myself fall into
the same necessity so as to take help from another; that my wife is what
she is, so obedient, so affectionate, and so simple; that I was well provided
with suitable tutors for my children. That I was granted assistance in
dreams, especially how to avoid spitting blood and fits of giddiness, and
the answer of the oracle at Caieta: ‘Even as thou shalt employ thyself; and
that, although in love with philosophy, I did not meet with any sophist or
retire to disentangle literary works or syllogisms or busy myself with
problems ‘in the clouds’.For all these things require ‘the gods to help and
Fortune’s hand’.""" ;

commonly do compare, various faults, that errors of appetite are graver than
errors of temper. For clearly one who loses his temper is turning away from
Reason with a kind of pain and inward spasm; whereas he who offends
through appetite is the victim of pleasure and is clearly more vicious in a
way and more effeminate in his wrong-doing. Rightly then and in a truly
philosophic spirit Theophrastus said that an offence attended with pleasure
involves greater censure than one attended with pain. And, generally, the
latter resembles more a man who was originally wronged and so is forced
by pain to lose his temper; the other has begun it himself and has been
impelled to do wrong, carried away by appetite to do what he does.

continually what is assigned to him from the Whole; his work he makes
perfect, his lot he is convinced is good; for the birth-spirit assigned to every
man goes with him and carries him along with it.
Moreover, he remembers that all reasonable beings are akin to himself, and
that although to care for all men is in accord with man’s nature, he is to
cling not to the opinion of all men, but only of men who live in accord with
Nature. Indeed, he remembers continually what those who do not so live are
like, in their homes and abroad, by night and by day; what manner of men

and you yourself, too, are peculiarly accustomed to feel the same want. Yet
all this is very unlike a philosopher, when you may at any hour you please
retreat into yourself. For nowhere does a man retreat into more quiet or
more privacy than into his own mind, especially one who has within such
things that he has only to look into, and become at once in perfect ease; and
by ease I mean nothing else but good behaviour. Continually, therefore,
grant yourself this retreat and repair yourself. But let them be brief and
fundamental truths, which will suffice at once by their presence to wash
away all sorrow, and to send you back without repugnance to the life to
which you return.
For what is it that shall move your repugnance? The wickedness of men?
Recall the judgement that reasonable creatures have come into the world for
the sake of one another; that patience is a part of justice; that men do wrong
involuntarily; and how many at last, after enmity, suspicion, hatred,
warfare, have been laid out on their death-beds and come to dust. This
should make you pause. But shall what is assigned from Universal Nature
be repugnant to you? Revive the alternative: ‘either Providence or blind
atoms’,
 and the many proofs that the Universe is a kind of Commonwealth.
Shall then the things of the flesh still have hold upon you? Reflect that the
understanding, when once it takes control of itself and recognizes its own
power, does not mingle with the vital spirit, be its current smooth or broken,
and finally reflect upon all that you have heard and consented to about pain
and pleasure.
Well, then, shall mere glory distract you? Look at the swiftness of the
oblivion of all men; the gulf of endless time, behind and before; the
hollowness of applause, the fickleness and folly of those who seem to speak
well of you, and the narrow room in which it is confined. This should make
you pause. For the entire earth is a point in space, and how small a corner
thereof is this your dwelling place, and how few and how paltry those who
will sing your praises here!
Finally, therefore, remember your retreat into this little domain which is
yourself, and above all be not disturbed nor on the rack, but be free and
look at things as a man, a human being, a citizen, a creature that must die.
And among what is most ready to hand into which you will look have these
two: the one, that things do not take hold upon the mind, but stand without
unmoved, and that disturbances come only from the judgement within; the
second, that all that your eyes behold will change in a moment and be no
more; and of how many things you have already witnessed the changes,
think continually of that.
The Universe is change, life is opinion.
